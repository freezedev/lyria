Lyria.js
Lightweight prototyping javascript game framework based on jQuery (and optionally HTML5 Canvas)
If you are looking for a full-fledged framework take a look at Charybdis

What does Lyria mean?
	- It's "freedom" in albanian (free as in not proprietary, free as in open-source)
	- It's also a reference to Lyrium from Bioware's Dragon Age series, in which Lyrium is the essence for magic
	- It's a reference to Illyria, a powerful being from the TV series Angel
